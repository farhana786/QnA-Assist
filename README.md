# QnA-Assist
It has Python scripts to build an LLM-powered chatbot named "QnA Assist" that aims to perform data exploration and question answering by writing and executing SQL queries on Snowflake data, also fetching data from API's. The application uses Streamlit and Snowflake and can be plugged into LLM, alongside data from Snowflake and API's.
This folder contains Python scripts to build a 'Data QnA Assist' application to interpret natural language questions and convert them into SQL queries, retrieving data from Snowflake database and provide response back to user in natural language. The application is divided into two parts:
1. Query Generation: Generates SQL queries from natural language questions.
2. Response: Generates SQL response back to user.
