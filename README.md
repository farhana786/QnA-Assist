# Data QnA-Assist
Aim of this project is to build an LLM-powered chatbot named "QnA Assist" that aims to perform data exploration and question answering by writing and executing SQL queries on Snowflake data, also fetching data from API's. The application uses Streamlit and Snowflake and can be plugged into LLM, alongside data from Snowflake and API's.
